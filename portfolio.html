    <p>Some times I would think too much, so much that I can't go to sleep, I have to get myself really tired and force myself to clear my mind, then finally I can get some rest. On the page I hide some function to lead you to the black screen. </p>

<p>Nice Walk</p>
<p>Audcity</p>
<p>Finally you are off work, it's been a long week. you are tired, and it's late. but something still on you mind, something that is been bugging you every day when you wake up. you need a place to go, you need to clear you mind. let's go to the beach, let's walk, walk a long as you need to. listen to the wave coming in to the seashore, feel the sand underneath your feet. grab a smoke. clear your mind.</p>

With 26 years of my life I moved a lot all over the place, but only two place I can really call home. Taiwan and Livermore. The street view image is the walk I been taking since I was born, I also used the google map of Taiwan and Livermore, I replace the build board with the two with in the map I put on google earth because those area are where I know the best. For the sky I changed it to google earth showing Taiwan, because that is the place where everything begin, and where my root is at.</p>

<p>Fade out</p>
<p>photo with corrupt coding</p>
<p>The Image I picked was from our first in-class work, the group assignment, I picked this image
because that one of the image is spider little and it mean something for me and I want to see how far I
can glitch it to my liking. I used fade out on this image, I was hoping to keep some of the color from the
original image, but it turn everything black and white. However, it still come out fascinating, it like
looking at an x-ray image.</p>
