  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>On thie website, I'm posting all the work that in been work on computer with program like
  Photoshop, illustrator, Premiere pro, Audacity, and P5JS coding program. All of them are experiment for
for classes project. I use a lot of personal experince and feelings on all my work.</p>
  <p>Like my lates project <em>Choas</em> is showing that as a student during the final week of school
    how life can feel like. I used P5JS to create the page, I alway have a lot of intert in coding,
    I learn a little C++ coding before I decied to become an Art Major student, so coding always
    have a spacel spot in my heart. Knowing that I can use coding to create art really change my idea of
    art. I hope you enjoy my work.
